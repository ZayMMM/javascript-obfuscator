# javascript-obfuscator
This project demonstrates how to use the JavaScript Obfuscator library to obfuscate JavaScript code in a Node.js application.

## Overview
JavaScript obfuscation is the process of converting readable JavaScript code into a less readable version to protect it from reverse engineering and unauthorized use. The JavaScript Obfuscator library provides tools and options to obfuscate JavaScript code effectively.

In this project, we have a simple Node.js application with an Express.js server (`app.js`) and a sample service module (`service/service.js`). We use the JavaScript Obfuscator library to obfuscate the code in the `service` module during the build process.

## Setup
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install dependencies:


## Usage
### npm install
To start the application in development mode with automatic restart using `nodemon`, run:

### npm start
This command will start the Express.js server and automatically restart it whenever changes are made to the code.
To build the application for production, which includes obfuscating the JavaScript code in the `service` module, run:

### npm run build
This command will obfuscate the JavaScript code in the `service` module using the JavaScript Obfuscator library and copy assets to the `build` directory.
To start the production-ready application, run:
